## What's GitHub Pages?

GitHub allows you to host static websites for free. The idea is simple: you create a GitHub repository, upload files of your static website to it (index.html file is necessary), and your website gets hosted on GitHub servers &mdash; exposed to the world via a 
dedicated URL.  


## How can I host my site on GitHub?

1. Log in to your GitHub account 
1. Create a new GitHub repository (make sure to initiate it with a README file).   
    * Top right hand side, there's a `+` button. Click on it and choose `New Repository`.  
2. In the newly created repo(sitory), create or upload an `index.html` file.  
    * Look for buttons `Create new file` or `Upload files`.
    * Feel free to use this template for basic HTML structure:
      * [Typical structure of HTML document](https://github.com/mkubera/bc_computing_stash/blob/master/tutorials/html.md#typical-structure-of-html-document)
    * To save your `index.html`, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click on `Commit changes`.
3. Now you need to enable Github Pages feature. Look for the `Settings` tab and click on it.  
3. Scroll down to 'Github Pages' section, locate 'Source', and from dropdown menu choose 'master branch'. Click `Save` button. 
3. The page will reload. Scroll down to 'Github Pages' again. There should be a URL to your website. Open it in a new tab.
3. SHAZAM! Your static web site is up and running.
