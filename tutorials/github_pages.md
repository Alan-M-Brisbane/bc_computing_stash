## What's GitHub Pages?

GitHub allows you to host static websites. The idea is simple: you have your repo with a static website 
(index.html file will be necessary) that is hosted on GitHub servers and exposed to the world via a 
dedicated URL.  
And, btw, it's free!

## How can I host my site on GitHub?

1. Log in to your GitHub account and Create a new GitHub repo (make sure to initiate it with a README file)
2. In the newly created repo, Go to 'Settings'
3. Scroll down to 'Github Pages', locate 'Source', and from dropdown menu choose 'master branch'. Click 'Save' btn. 
A URL will appear, copy it
4. Go back to your repo's main page on GitHub
5. Upload your files (index.html is a must) OR Create a new file (call it 'index.html')
6. Go to the copied url
7. SHAZAM! Your static web site is up and running
