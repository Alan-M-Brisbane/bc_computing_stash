# Instructions

This Assessment is done in groups. However, every task is done individually.  

1. **First**, work in groups of 5 (in your row, in the classroom).  
1. **Second**, each member of the group:
    * picks up 3 topics, 
    * researches them (reads about them & gathers information), 
    * and (for each chosen topic) creates one forum topic, writing about his/her findings. 
    * (The list of topics is below.)
1. **Three**, once having written all 15 forum topics across your group, every student writes at least one comment (forum post) in a chosen topic created by one of the student's group members.  
1. **Fourth**, finally, one student in each group creates a new topic in which the group will be discussing the issue provided ([Issue: Advantages vs Disadvantages of Social Media for Society](#issue-advantages-vs-disadvantages-of-social-media-for-society)). All members of the group are expected to contribute to this forum topic on a weekly basis (finding new information, new articles, new videos, on the matter). For example, a UK newspaper reports on a malign usage of social media. A student writes about the article and adds a link to the article so others can read about it as well. Then, the group discusses it (on the forums).

Describing your findings, try to use as professional language as possible. Always use your own words, but feel free to use quotations and links to other sources.  

Check this thread (an example) to understand how to go about things: https://moodle.borderscollege.ac.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=3042. If you are unsure what to do, ask your Lecturer.

## 6 what’s meant by ‘social intelligence’, ‘social production’ and ‘social capital’ (1c)

### 6a social intelligence

Social intelligence is the capacity to know oneself and to know others.

read more on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_intelligence

---

Social Intelligence (SI) is the ability to successfully build relationships and navigate social environments.

Our society puts a huge emphasis on book smarts and IQ, but our relationships effect a much bigger part of our lives. In this post, I want to argue that your social smarts are far more important than your book smarts. And building strong social relationships is worth the effort:

Strong relationships improve our immune system and help combat disease.
Loneliness and weak relationships are one of the major sources of stress, health problems and depression.
Our relationships affect every area of our lives–from colleagues to spouses to friends to kids.

from https://www.scienceofpeople.com/social-intelligence/


### 6b social production

A new model of socioeconomic production in which large numbers of people work cooperatively (usually over the Internet). Commons-based projects generally have less rigid hierarchical structures than those under more traditional business models. Often—but not always—commons-based projects are designed without a need for financial compensation for contributors. For example, sharing of STL (file format) design files for objects freely on the internet enables anyone with a 3-D printer to digitally replicate (distributed manufacture) the object[2][3] saving the prosumer significant money.

from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production

### 6c social capital

Social capital is the value that comes from social networks, or groupings of people, which allow individuals to achieve things they couldn't on their own.

## 12 using social media for learning (1e)

## Personal Learning Network (PLN)

"Personal Learning Networks have been around for some time.  The idea of a PLN is simply a network of people and resources through which you learn and grow."  

and  

"A student personal learning network is, therefore, a rich and ever-growing series of connections with people, resources, and communities around the world…connections that allow us to grow in knowledge, skill, ability and perspective. "
