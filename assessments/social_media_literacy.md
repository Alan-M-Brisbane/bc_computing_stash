# Instructions

This Assessment is done in groups, however, every task is done individually.  

1. First, work in groups of 5 (in your row).  
1. Second, each member of the group picks up 3 topics, reads about them, and creates one forum topic (for each topic), writing about his/her findings. (The list of topics is below.)
1. Three, once having 15 forum threads, write at least one comment (forum post) about a member of your team created (not you), and discuss his/her findings.  
1. Fourth, finally, have one of your team members (or you) create a new topic with the issue provided (you will find it at the end of this text). Discuss it among yourselves. Each student should write at least 1 post.

Describing your findings, try to use as professional language as possible. Always use your own words, but feel free to use quotations and links to other sources.  

Check this thread (an example) to understand how to go about things: https://moodle.borderscollege.ac.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=3042. If you are unsure what to do, ask your Lecturer.

## 6 what’s meant by ‘social intelligence’, ‘social production’ and ‘social capital’

### 6a social intelligence

Social intelligence is the capacity to know oneself and to know others.

---

Social Intelligence (SI) is the ability to successfully build relationships and navigate social environments.

Our society puts a huge emphasis on book smarts and IQ, but our relationships effect a much bigger part of our lives. In this post, I want to argue that your social smarts are far more important than your book smarts. And building strong social relationships is worth the effort:

Strong relationships improve our immune system and help combat disease.
Loneliness and weak relationships are one of the major sources of stress, health problems and depression.
Our relationships affect every area of our lives–from colleagues to spouses to friends to kids.

### 6b social production

A new model of socioeconomic production in which large numbers of people work cooperatively (usually over the Internet). Commons-based projects generally have less rigid hierarchical structures than those under more traditional business models. Often—but not always—commons-based projects are designed without a need for financial compensation for contributors. For example, sharing of STL (file format) design files for objects freely on the internet enables anyone with a 3-D printer to digitally replicate (distributed manufacture) the object[2][3] saving the prosumer significant money.

### 6c social capital

Social capital is the value that comes from social networks, or groupings of people, which allow individuals to achieve things they couldn't on their own.
